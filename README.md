First you need to have an csv file in the following columns:

1. English_words
2. Hebrew_meaning
3. score

you can see an example below:
![img.jpg](readme_src/csv_file.jpg)

Then you can run the main (from the IDE or from the commend line by: "get\to\file\location python main.py)

Now when the game has started and you get to the main screen (the first picture) you can navigate between the screens:

## Search & Save new words
![saveword_screen.jpg](readme_src/saveword_screen.jpg) 
<br>
    Here you type a word for search (only in english),
    by typing ENTER you get the Hebrew meaning.
    Then you can search a new word but if you want to add it to the csv file
    you should first press the 'save word' button.
